# maemu

An emulator for the SEGA Master System, written as an educational exercise.

This emulator is currently slow, buggy, and innacurate, and provides precisely zero benefits over any alternative currently available.

If you're interested in the code, welcome! If you're interested in playing games, this isn't ready yet, sorry.
